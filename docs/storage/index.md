## What is Object storage?
Object storage is a way to store lots of data in a simple and flexible manner. Instead of organizing data into folders and files like on a computer, it treats each piece of data as a separate "object" with a unique name. These objects can be anything, like pictures, videos, or documents. Object storage is highly scalable, meaning it can handle a huge amount of data without slowing down. It also keeps copies of data to make sure it doesn't get lost. This type of storage is often used in cloud computing because it's cost-effective and easy to manage.
